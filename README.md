[supply chain fundamentals from MIT EDX](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:MITx+CTL.SC1x+3T2017/course/)

This is a personal repositary where the author used to store solutions to certain class materials using analytical tools like Python or other advanced open source solutions. It is meant to share new perspectives of solving classic supply chain problems. 

If you are a student that is also taking the same course, think twice before you think this is gonna save you time. Theoretically, you SHOULD solve the problem by yourself and in the end, might even spend more time by reading my code, so be responsible. 

If you are the content creator of the course, MIT, EDX, please let me know if there is misuse any of the content and I will be more than glad to make any modification required. 

Hopefully this repo is helpful.
